## Setup

I'm currently running Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa). With its user-friendly interface and robust command-line capabilities, Ubuntu provides a stable platform for me to efficiently manage tasks and customize my system to fit my needs. I'm using the Zsh shell.

1️⃣ To start this task, I created this GitHub repo and cloned it locally.

Then I created the text file using the following commands:

```bash
# Create File
touch file.txt
nano file.txt
```

The text was then copied and pasted in, then saved 💾

## Questions

1. How many lines in this file?

```bash
wc -l file.txt
```

Answer: 98

2. How many “Z” Characters in this file ?
```bash
grep -o 'Z' file.txt | wc -l
```

Answer: 44

3. Find on which line is “Junior”, “Platform” and “Engineer”, not case
sensitive.
```bash
grep -in 'Junior' file.txt
grep -in 'Platform' file.txt
grep -in 'Engineer' file.txt
```

Junior: 65

Platform: 28

Engineer: 88

4. Change “Junior” to “Senior”
```bash
sed -i 's/Junior/Senior/g' file.txt
```

## Explanations

wc: "word count"

-l: Tells the wc command to count only the lines

grep: Searching for lines

-o: Output only the matching parts of the lines

'Z': Pattern to search for

|: Redirects output of previous command to input of next command.

-i: Case-insensitive

-n: Line numbering

sed: Parsing and transforming text

-i: Modifies file directly

's/Junior/Senior/g': Subsitute every occurrence of Junior with Senior. g: replace all occurrences on each line
